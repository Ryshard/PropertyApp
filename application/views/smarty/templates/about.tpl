                       You are  required to create  property listing website with a front end and an admin back end. The site is to be driven by PHP and MySQL 
                   </p>
                   <p>
The front end will show a listing of all properties available for sale. The user will be able to filter the listing based on county, price and house type. Front end filters must reload data using JSON and Ajax
        </p>
        <p>
The admin section is protected by a login. Within the admin section you will need to be able to add, update and delete properties for sale.  Each listing must have a photograph uploaded. 
        </p>
        <p>
There will be a flag to indicate whether it is sold or not. 
        </p>
        <p>
PHP code must demonstrate separation of HTML  and PHP. SQL Code must have at least three joined tables and demonstrate dates / timestamps, varchars, integers and auto-incrementing values and foreign keys. House types will include detached, semi-detached, terraced. Houses must have at least 3 address lines and a county. 
        </p>
        <p>
Up to 5 additional marks are awarded for placing your site on an external web server.
        </p>


        <h4>Specific Instructions: </h4>
        <ul> <li> 
House addresses should only be a street address and a county. Specific suburbs of Dublin, postal codes etc. are not required.
            </li><li> 
The date the house listing was created / updated should be stored in the database and displayed in the backend. It does not need to be shown publicly.
</li><li> 
There is no requirement to manage admin users. Create a single admin user whose credentials are stored in a adminuser table. Username should be ‘admin’ and password should be ‘letmein’
</li><li> 
From a UI perspective, you are expected to use some form of CSS framework - such as the 960.gs framework or Twitter’s BootStrap and a templating system such as Smarty.
</li><li> 
All code and documents should be compressed as a zip or archive file. It must contain file with the SQL setup (structure and data) required to recreate your site on a local machine. 
</li><li> 
There should be a configuration file with variables clearly commented indicating what needs to be changed for a local set up – e.g. db name, db user, db password etc.  
Ensure you do NOT use personal passwords for your project (i.e. passwords you would use for email etc.)
</li><li> 
Username for backend should be ‘admin’ and password should be letmein
